## 👩🏽 About Me  

I’m a data scientist and analytics professional who enjoys building intelligent systems that connect data with business strategy. 

I’m currently pursuing my M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago, where I focus on building end-to-end machine learning systems — from data pipelines to model deployment — and measuring the business impact of these systems. 

Before graduate school, I worked across data and marketing technology roles that taught me to see data through both technical and strategic lenses:  

- 🧩 **ITCAN Technology** – Designed company-wide tracking infrastructure across app, web, and campaign platforms using Firebase, Adjust, and GTM. Automated analytics workflows and Tableau dashboards that improved cross-team data accuracy by over **30%**.  
- 📊 **Gupta Media** – Managed analytics for $30M+ in annual media spend, building ETL pipelines with Python, Rivery, and BigQuery. Developed marketing-mix and churn models with A/B testing that guided budget allocation and performance strategy for global clients.  

I love working at the intersection of **data, product, and strategy**, where technical solutions meet measurable outcomes.  

Outside of work, you’ll find me cooking elaborate meals for friends, listening to music history podcasts, or trying to master the guitar (still a work in progress). 🎸
